[Intro]
| Em    |

| C     | Em Bm |

| C     | Em Bm |


[Verse 1]
C
Thought I found a way
Em                       Bm
Thought I found a way, out (out)
     C
But you never go away (never go away)
     Em                  Bm
So I guess I gotta stay now



[Pre-Chorus]
                 C                Em     Bm
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
            C                    Em      Bm
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                 C                 Em       Bm
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
             C                     Em       Bm
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear



[Chorus]
C
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Em                      Bm
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
C
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Em        Bm           C
   Hello, welcome home



[Verse 2]
C
Walking out of time
Em                           Bm
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
C
Something's on my mind
Em                      Bm
Always in my headspace



[Pre-Chorus]
                 C                Em     Bm
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
            C                    Em      Bm
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                 C                 Em       Bm
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
             C                     Em       Bm
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear



[Chorus]
C
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Em                      Bm
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
C
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Em        Bm
   Hello, welcome home

C         Em        Bm
     Woah-oah, yeah-yeah, ah
C                       Em
Yeahhhhhhh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Bm
Woah, woah
C     Em  Bm

C     Em        Bm               Cmaj7/E
