Capo: +4, Velocity: 0, Original Key: F#m, My Key: G#m (+2)


[Verse 1]
Em       C             G     D
I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Em       C             G     D
Why am I doing this to myself
Em        C              G   D
Losing my mind on a tiny error
Em                C              G
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
            D
No, no, no, no
 


[Chorus] 
Em                  C  G                    D
Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
Em         C                     G
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
                 D
It's okay not to be okay
Em             C    G
Sometimes it's hard
                    D
to follow your heart
Em                      C
Tears don't mean you're losing
            G
everybody's bruising
                D
Just be true to who you are
Em
Who you are
        C
Who you are
 
Who you are
G
Who you are
 
Who you are
        D
Who you are

[Verse 2]
Em          C               G        D
Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
Em               C                  G
I forgot what to do to fit the mould
Em         C                  G
The more I try, the less it's working
Em              C
'cos everything inside me
        G                      D
screams no, no, no, no, no, no, no
 


[Chorus]
Em                  C  G                     D
Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
Em         C                     G
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
                 D
It's okay not to be okay
Em             C    G
Sometimes it's hard
                    D
to follow your heart
Em                      C
Tears don't mean you're losing
            G
everybody's bruising
                D
There's nothing wrong with who you are
 


[Bridge] 
D         Em
Yes, No, egos
                C
fake shows like WOAH
             G
Just go, and leave me alone
D               Em
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
C
With a smile...

That's my home, yeah
Em
That's my home...
 


[Chorus] 
Em                  C  G                     D
Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
Em         C                     G
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
                 D
It's okay not to be okay
Em             C    G
Sometimes it's hard
                    D
to follow your heart
Em                      C
Tears don't mean you're losing
            G
everybody's bruising
                D
Just be true to who you are
Em
No no no no
