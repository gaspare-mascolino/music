James Arthur - Impossible

Capo: +2, Velocity: 0, Original Key: Cm, My Key: Bm (-1)

 
[Verse 1]
Am
I remember years ago
C
Someone told me I should take
G
Caution when it comes to love
F
I did, I did
Am
And you were strong and I was not
C
My illusion, my mistake
G
I was careless, I forgot
F
I did



[Pre-Chorus]
     F
And now when all is done
                     G
There is nothing to say
                                F
You have gone and so effortlessly
 
You have won
                  G
You can go ahead tell them



[Chorus]
                 Am
Tell them all I know now
                   C
Shout it from the rooftops
                  G
Write it on the skyline
               F
All we had is gone now
                 Am
Tell them I was happy
                C
And my heart is broken
                  G
All my scars are open
                  F
Tell them what I hoped would be
        Am          C
Impossible, impossible
        G            F
Impossible, impossible



[Verse 2]
Am
Falling out of love is hard
C
Falling for betrayal is worse
G
Broken trust and broken hearts
F
I know, I know
Am
Thinking all you need is there
C
Building faith on love and words
G
Empty promises will wear
F
I know (i know)



[Pre-Chorus]
     F
And now when all is done
                     G
There is nothing to say
                                     F
And if you're done with embarrassing me
 
On your own
                  G
You can go ahead tell them



[Chorus]
                 Am
Tell them all I know now
                   C
Shout it from the rooftops
                  G
Write it on the skyline
               F
All we had is gone now
                 Am
Tell them I was happy
                C
And my heart is broken
                  G
All my scars are open
                  F
Tell them what I hoped would be
        Am          C
Impossible, impossible
        G            F
Impossible, impossible



[Verse 3]
Am
I remember years ago
C
Someone told me I should take
G
Caution when it comes to love
F
I did



[Chorus]
                 Am
Tell them all I know now
                   C
Shout it from the rooftops
                  G
Write it on the skyline
               F
All we had is gone now
Am
Tell them I was happy
C
And my heart is broken
G
Oh no, oh no
                  F
Tell them what I hoped would be
        Am          C
Impossible, impossible
        G            F
Impossible, impossible
        Am          C
Impossible, impossible
        G            F
Impossible, impossible
