[Intro]
Am   F   C   G

Am   F   C   G E
 

[Verse 1]
Am       F              C         G
Feeling my way through the darkness
Am       F          C         G
Guided by a beating heart 
Am       F              C         G
I can't tell where the journey will end 
Am       F          C         G
But I know where it starts 
Am       F              C         G
They tell me I'm too young to understand,
Am       F          C         G
They say I'm caught up in a dream 
Am       F              C         G
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Am       F          C         G
Well that's fine by me
 


[Chorus]
            Am      F       C     G
So wake me up when it's all over 
          Am    F     C        G
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
        Am         F           C       G
All this time I was finding myself, And I 
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
            Am      F       C     G
So wake me up when it's all over 
          Am    F     C        G
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
        Am         F           C       G
All this time I was finding myself, And I 
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
 


[Verse 2]
Am       F              C         G
I tried carrying the weight of the world
Am       F          C         G
But I only have two hands
Am       F              C         G
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
Am       F          C         G
But I don't have any plans
Am       F              C         G
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Am       F          C         G
Not afraid to close my eyes
Am       F              C         G
Life's a game made for everyone
Am       F          C         G
And love is the prize
 


[Chorus]
            Am      F       C     G
So wake me up when it's all over 
          Am    F     C        G
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
        Am         F           C       G
All this time I was finding myself, And I 
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
            Am      F       C     G
So wake me up when it's all over 
          Am    F     C        G
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
        Am         F           C       G
All this time I was finding myself, And I 
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost



[Outro]
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
Am      F     C      G
didn't know I was lost
