[Verse]
G/B       C                  Em         Gmaj7/D
  Shadows settle on the place  that you left.
G/B             C               Em       Gmaj7/D
  Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
G/B           C              Em          Gmaj7/D
  Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.
         G/B     C            Em         Gmaj7/D
From the perfect start to the finish line.

       G/B            C                  Em         Gmaj7/D
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
        G/B         C           Em         Gmaj7/D
Setting fire to our insides for fun
           G/B          C                     Em
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
    Gmaj7/D
The lovers that went wrong.

[Verse]
G/B          C                    Em         Gmaj7/D
  We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
        G/B        C              Em         Gmaj7/D
Chasing visions of our futures
    G/B       C          Em            Gmaj7/D
One day we'll reveal the truth
              G/B           C           Em   Gmaj7/D
That one will die before he gets there.



[Chorus]
       G/B          C                    Em         Gmaj7/D
And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones.
       G/B         C                  Em                     Gmaj7/D
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone.
               G/B        C           Em            Gmaj7/D
We're setting fire to our insides for fun.
           G/B               C                      Em
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home,
         Gmaj7/D
It was a flood that wrecked this...



[Bridge]
Em                    C   Gmaj7/D

                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D
  And you caused it,
                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D
  And you caused it,
                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D
  And you caused it,



[Chorus]
       G/B        C                     Em        Gmaj7/D
And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one,
       G/B            C           Em          Gmaj7/D
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
        G/B         C           Em     Gmaj7/D
Setting fire to our insides for fun,
   G/B                      C            Em
To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
        Gmaj7/D
But I'm forever missing him.

                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D
  And you caused it,
                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D
  And you caused it,
                 Em   C   Gmaj7/D Em
  And you caused it
