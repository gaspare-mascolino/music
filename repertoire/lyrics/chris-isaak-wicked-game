[Intro]
Bm  A  E  X2


[Verse 1]
Bm                         A                       E
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
Bm                            A                    E
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.
 


[Chorus]
    Bm A                   E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Bm A                   E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)

With you.         With you.       (This world is only gonna break your heart)
 


[Verse 2]
Bm             A           E
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
Bm               A        E
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
Bm              A          E
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
Bm              A         E
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you. 
 


[Chorus]
     Bm A                   E
And, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Bm A                   E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)

With you.
