[Intro]
Am    F      C Cadd9


[Verse 1]
Am                         F                   C  Cadd9
Early in the morning I still get a little bit nervous
Am                  F                      C     Cadd9
Fighting my anxiety constantly I try to control it
Am                          F                         C     Cadd9
Even when I know it’s been forever I can still feel the spin
Am                          F                  C      Cadd9
Hurts when I remember and I never wanna feel it again



[Pre-Chorus]
G                                Em                          F
Don’t know if you get it cause I can’t express how thankful I am
G                                Em                            F
That you were always with me when it hurts I know that you understand



[Chorus]
               Am    F        C
I don’t wanna lose        control
               Am    F      C
Nothing I can do         anymore
               F             G   Am
Trying every day when I hold my breath
                 G                     C
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest
               Am   F       C
I don’t wanna lose      control



[Verse 2]
Am                          F                      C    Cadd9
Sometimes I still think it’s coming but I know it’s not
Am                          F                      C    Cadd9
Trying to breathe in and then out but the air gets caught
Am                                    F                        C     Cadd9
Cause even though I’m older now and I know how to shake off the past
Am                          F                          C     Cadd9
I would’t have made it if I did’t have you holding my hand



[Chorus]
               Am    F        C
I don’t wanna lose        control
               Am    F      C
Nothing I can do         anymore
               F             G    Am
Trying every day when I hold my breath
                 G                     C
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest
               Am   F       C
I don’t wanna lose      control



[Bridge]
    F                      Am                           G
I need you to know I would never be this strong without you
                       C
You’ve seen how I’ve grown you took all my doubt
      Am    F        C
Cause you        were home



[Chorus]
               Am    F        C
I don’t wanna lose        control
                   Am    F      C
There’s nothing I can do      anymore
               Am    F        C
I don’t wanna lose        control
                Am    F      C
Nothing I can do         anymore      anymore
               F             G    Am
Trying every day when I hold my breath
                 G                     C
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest
               Am    F        C
I don’t wanna lose        control
