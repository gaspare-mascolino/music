[Intro]
Am  C  x2


[Verse 1]
 Am                                                      C
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
   Am                                                  C
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
   Am                                F                            
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us 
C
in her bones
   Am                                F                            
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on 
C
my stone
 


[Pre-Chorus]
           F     G      Am
And I'll be gone gone tonight
                      F      G     Am
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
                     F     G      Am
The way that I been holding on too tight
                    G
With nothing in between
 


[Chorus]
      C
The story of my life I take her home
   F
I drive all night to keep her warm
     Am
and time
      C     F  C  F
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
      C
The story of my life I give her hope
   F                                 Am
I spend her love until she's broke inside
                C    F     C      F
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
 


[Verse 2]
 Am                                                 C
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
 Am                                                 C
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
 Am                                            F                 
I know that in the morning, now I'll see us in the light up 
C
on the hill
 Am                      F                 C
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
 


[Pre-Chorus]
           F    G       Am
And I'll be gone gone tonight
                   F       G       Am
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
                   F       G     Am
The way that I been holding on so tight
                  G
With nothing in between
 


[Chorus]
      C
The story of my life I take her home
   F
I drive all night to keep her warm
     Am
and time
      C     F  C   F
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
      C
The story of my life I give her hope
   F                                 Am
I spend her love until she's broke inside
                C    F     C      F
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

 


[Bridge]
            Am                               G
And I been waiting for this time to come around
         F                                       G
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
C                  
The story of my life I take her home
   F
I drive all night to keep her warm
     Am
and time
      C     F   C   F
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
 


[Chorus]
      C
The story of my life I give her hope
   F                                 Am
I spend her love until she's broke inside
                C       F       C       F
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
 


[Outro]
                C       F
The story of my life
                Am          F
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
                 C
The story of my life
