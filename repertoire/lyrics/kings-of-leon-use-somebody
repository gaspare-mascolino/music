                        C                      C/E             F
I've been roaming around,  Always looking down at all I see
         C               C/E           F
Painted faces fill the places I canâ€™t reach



[Chorus 1]
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody
 


[Verse 2]
             C                 C/E               F
Someone like you, and all you know, And how you speak
             C          C/E           F
Countless lovers under cover of the street
 
[Chorus 1]
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody

[Verse 3]
             C                     C/E               F
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
       C                  C/E             F
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
                  Am             C F
I hope it's gonna make you notice
                  Am             C F
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me Ooooahh Ooooahh   Ah hhhh
             C          C/E       F
Someone like me Somebody           Ah hhhh
             C          C/E         F
Someone like me Ooooahh Ooooahh   Ah hhhh
             C        C/E         F
Someone like me Somebody           Ah hhhh
