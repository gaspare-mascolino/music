[Intro]
Am        F
 
 
[Verse 1]
            Am                                    F
There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
           Am                                F
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne               
               G             Am                  F
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
           G              Am                 F
I hear the songs from the places where I was born



[Pre-Chorus]
Am                              F
Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                  Am
That's where I had my first heartbreak
                            F
I still remember how it all changed
           G
My father said
 
 

[Chorus]
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
C                            G
See heaven's got a plan for you
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
C                            G
Yeah!
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
C                            G
See heaven's got a plan for you
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
C                            G
Yeah!
 
 

[Verse 2]
           Am                                 F
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
             Am                                           F
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
           G         Am                  F
We were so young, I think of her now and then
                 G        Am             F
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend



[Pre-Chorus]
Am                              F
Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                  Am
That's where I had my first heartbreak
                            F
I still remember how it all changed
F
My father said
 
 

[Chorus]
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
C                            G
See heaven's got a plan for you
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
C                            G
Yeah!
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
C                            G
See heaven's got a plan for you
           Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
C                            G
Yeah!



[Outro]
Am             F    
  Ooh ooh ooh oh!
C           G
  Ooh ooh ooh oh!
Am             F    
  Ooh ooh ooh oh!
C                           G                  
See heaven's got a plan for you
