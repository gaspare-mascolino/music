[Verse 1]
C
   I swear to God, when I come home
Am7
   I'm gonna hold you so close
Fsus2                                                C
   I swear to God, when I come home, I'll never let go
C
   Like a river I flow
Am7
   To the ocean I know
Fsus2                              C
   You pull me close, guiding me home



[Chorus]
    C
And I need you to know
     Am7
That we're falling so fast
      Fsus2                               C
We're falling like the stars, falling in love
    C                           Am7
And I'm not scared to say those words
                         Fsus2
With you I'm safe, we're falling like the stars
                  C
We're falling in love



[Verse 2]
C
   I swear to God, I can see
Am7
   Four kids and no sleep
Fsus2                                   C
   We'll have one on each knee, you and me, hmm
C
   And when they've grown up
Am7
   You're still the girl in the club
Fsus2                                            C
   When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much



[Chorus]
    C
And I need you to know
     Am7
That we're falling so fast
      Fsus2                               C
We're falling like the stars, falling in love
    C                           Am7
And I'm not scared to say those words
                         Fsus2
With you I'm safe, we're falling like the stars
                  C
We're falling in love



[Verse 3]
C
   I swear to God, every day
Am7
   He won't take you away
Fsus2                                  C
  'Cause without you, babe, I lose my way



[Bridge]
            C                                 Am7
Oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in love
            Fsus2                             C
Oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in love (Falling like the stars)



[Chorus]
    C
And I need you to know
     Am7
That we're falling so fast
      Fsus2                               C
We're falling like the stars, falling in love
    C                           Am7
And I'm not scared to say those words
                         Fsus2
With you I'm safe, we're falling like the stars
                  C
We're falling in love
